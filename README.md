The shader requires :

*An interior atlas with the albedo of the interior ... 4x4 textures:
	- first column is the ground texture
	- second column is the ceiling texture
	- third one is the sidewall texture (streched x2)
	- fourth one is the backwall texture (stretched x2)
*window atlas with 4 variations of the window (open->closed window blinds)
*window normal map
*window Roughness/Metalness/Glass texture (glass is used as mask for some effects in the shader.)

Optional :
*Decoration atlas with 4 walls random feature/poster/whatever you want ... 

I hope you'll enjoy it, have fun!

A samples scene is provided with several variations of the shader.
